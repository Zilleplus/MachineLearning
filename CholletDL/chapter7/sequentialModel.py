# keras specific:
# When using sequential model we don't need to say
# input and output layer, the build function does this
# when the first data is applied to the system.
# In order to see the weights we will call it manually here.
# -> batch size doesn't matter here...

# each layer is of the shape activation(a*x + b)

# First layer:
model.weights[0].shape  # [3, 64] weights -> a
model.weights[1].shape  # [64] weights -> b

# Second layer:
model.weights[2].shape  # [64, 10] -> a
model.weights[3].shape  # [10] -> b
